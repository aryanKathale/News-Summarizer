News Summarization
Internship Project

Overview Welcome to the Text Summarization Framework repository! This project is developed as part of NewsSumm, aimed at creating a robust and efficient text summarization tool. The framework is designed to condense large volumes of text into concise summaries using advanced natural language processing techniques.

Features

Extractive Summarization: Utilizes algorithms to identify and extract key sentences or phrases from input text.
Abstractive Summarization: Implements models capable of generating summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing the original content.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and viewing generated summaries.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes evaluation scripts to measure the performance of the summarization framework using established metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU scores.
Installation

To set up the text summarization framework on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone

Navigate to the project directory: cd text-summarization-framework

Install dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Training To train the text summarization models, explore the provided scripts and notebooks in the train directory. You can fine-tune existing models or experiment with new architectures based on your specific requirements.

Testing Evaluate the performance of the summarization framework by running the provided evaluation scripts and notebooks in the test directory. Compare the generated summaries against ground truth summaries using established evaluation metrics.

User Interface Interact with the summarization framework through the user interface by executing the main application script: python main.py The user interface allows for easy input of text documents and provides a platform to view the generated summaries.
